The player stands in a long hallway, with a single door at the end. A single strip of lighting attached to the ceiling of the center of the hall illuminates the room. The hallway is completely white with simple shadows cast by the spherical lighting. A prompt guides the player through basic movement controls. WASD to move, [] to interact. 

Once the player has advanced to simple outline of a door and interacted with it, it swings open and the scene blacks out to render the next area.
